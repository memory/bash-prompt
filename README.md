# My dumb bash prompt

Adapted from Dave Vehrs' `custom_prompt.sh` and hacked
to add support for git/mercurial repos (show current
branch and dirty file count), per-prompt datestamps,
and color coding based on exit value.

## To install

* check this out somewhere
* add to your `.bash_profile`:

```
. ~/<PATH TO>/prompt.sh
```
